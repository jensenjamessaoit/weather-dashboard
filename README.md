## Usage
Simply type any city in the search bar, it will display the current weather and the forecast up to 5 days. For example, I am going to visit my family in Hawaii and I'm having trouble deciding what to pack. So I use this web app to check the forecast and see that it's going storming a bunch in Honolulu, now I know to pack accordingly based on the weather.
